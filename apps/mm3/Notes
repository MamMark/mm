1) Why does Msp430AlamC$Init$Init get called twice?  Once for Timers
   and once for msp430Alarms?

2) On Vdiff power up with a Vdiff sensor.  Where should the power up of the
   sensor show up?

   Argues for sensor timing scheduling.  To get the optimum (minimum waiting
   time).  Currently probably waits too long.  Serializes vdiff swing and
   sensor power up (if first piece).  If vdiff already on.

3) How to structure sharing files between telosb and mm3?  Can't seem to
   get telosb to build with own platform files.  Even when mm3 files copied
   over.
