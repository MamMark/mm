1) Why does Msp430AlamC$Init$Init get called twice?  Once for Timers
   and once for msp430Alarms?

2) On Vdiff power up with a Vdiff sensor.  Where should the power up of the
   sensor show up?

   Argues for sensor timing scheduling.  To get the optimum (minimum waiting
   time).  Currently probably waits too long.  Serializes vdiff swing and
   sensor power up (if first piece).  If vdiff already on.

5) Why does MainBoot.booted get called twice?
   SerialAMControl.start()

   doesn't hurt anything (posts startDoneTask twice, which executes one)
