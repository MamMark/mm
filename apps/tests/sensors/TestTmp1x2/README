README for TestTmp1x2

These are test applications for the Tmp1x2 driver.  The App
does a reading, which you can examine by setting a breakpoint on
the nop() call in TempSensor.readDone().  Modify convert.c to
convert the value you find to degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.

There is also wiring for a timer, but the timer isn't used yet.
