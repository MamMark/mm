README for TestTMP112
Tod Landis <go@todlandis.com>

These are test applications for the TMP112 driver.  TestTempApp 
does a reading, which you can examine by setting a breakpoint on
the nop() call in TempSensor.readDone().  Modify convert.c to
convert the value you find to degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.

There is also wiring for a timer, but the timer isn't used yet.
