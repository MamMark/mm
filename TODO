Failure Recovery

If we detect memory corruption,  PANIC and REBOOT.


How do we want the machine to degrade if there are failures?

- If Collect/StreamStorage/SD fails what to do?
- Could keep status of each subsystem and only allow the subsystem to work if the subsystem is up.

- What we want...  If something goes wrong we want to note it in some fashion so we can see it.

1st tier: log into SD.  Panic.warn
  (assume collect, Stream, and SD are all up)  If they aren't more is wrong than what we are
  warning about so we have other things to worry about.

2nd tier: log via comm.  But how does this work if we aren't communicating.  Try and if
   not connected than it gets dropped.

3rd tier: Panic code writes image into panic area (ram gets written to SD).  Need panic
manager to control where the image gets written.


Need versioning.  So if we look at a ram image we can correlate it to a code version.
