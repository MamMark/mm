- observe all messages sent by default.  need to write them to SD

- gps_boot vs. operational.  Operation optimized for nav reading.  no need to
  reinitilize.

  gps_boot sends configuration commands.

- have gps come up, take some readings, and shutdown.  (full cycle)

- what does gps sampling cycle look like?

  pwr on, sample (how many?), pwr off

  pwr is already on, sampling?
