This is the MamMark tinyos 2 tree.

MamMark is an advanced low power, sensor array, for monitoring animals and
their environment.  Originally it was designed for marine mammals (mammal
marker, mammark) but is no longer limited to those environments.

The core OS is based on TinyOS 2.  Significant changes have been made for
support of more modern msp430 processors.  These changes are held on the
gh:tinyprod/prod repository.  The working development trunk of TinyProd
is the gh:tp-freeforall/prod repository.  Additional changes are on the
mm_core branch (based off tp-master).

See doc/00_README for installing a complete development environment.  Also
see: (doc directory) 01_Platforms, Notes, Status.txt, and ToDo.


Platforms:

mm3:	msp430f1611 (prototype)
mm4:	msp430f2618 (prototype)
mm5a:	msp430f5438a (prototype and production)


Other development platforms:

the exp5438 is TI's MSP-EXP430F5438 development board.

exp5438_5t:     dev board with various sensors
exp5438_gps:    dev board with gps and radio


Centralized repositories are hosted at github.com.  github:tinyprod/prod
and gh:tp-freeforall/prod are downstream stable and development
(respective) versions of the T2 core source.  While gh:MamMark/mm hosts
the main body of the MamMark source.  Detail on tinyprod and tp-freeforall
can be found at:

https://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod/blob/tp-master/00a_Repo_Notes

Syntax used for github repositories is: gh:<context>/<repo>(<branch>)
gh: indicates the repo is hosted at github.com.  <context> indicates
the owner of the repository.  <repo> is the specific repo under <context>.
And <branch> denotes a specific branch inside of that repository.   ie.

    gh:tinyprod/prod(master) can be obtained by cloning the url
    git://github.com/tinyprod/prod.git and then checking out the branch
    master.   This would be a read-only reference.   See github for more
    details on how to access github repositories.

gt:tinyprod/prod(mm_core) is a T2 core with modifications needed by the
MM application suite.  Prod tracks the mainline T2 git trunk
(gh:tinyos/tinyos-main).  The branch mm_core tracks changes to the t2 core
needed for the mm software load.

gh:MamMark/mm contains the majority of the MM tracking code including
various device drivers for mass storage (SD), GPS, and sensor drivers.

You need working copies of both repos to build code for the mm5 platform.
gh:tp-freeforall/prod(mm_core) and gh:MamMark/mm(master) are the
repositories needed for the build.  See doc/00_README for instruction on
how to set up a development environment and detailed instructions on
obtaining the source code.
