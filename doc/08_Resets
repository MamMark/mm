The MSP432 provides for the following classes of reset:

** Class 0 - Power On/Off Reset (POR)

- depending on source of the reset, different wake-up latencies may be
  experienced.
- May be initiated by PSS, PCM, RSTn pin, CS if DCO xR short fault or
  via the debug port (JTAG).
- loses connectivity with the debug port.
- latency from release of device POR to release of hard reset - 15-25 secs


** Class 1 - Reboot Reset

- identical to PORT but doesn't power cycle the device.
- leaves the debug port if any connected.


** Class 2 - Hard Reset

- resets all modules that are set up or modified by the application
- all peripherals and nondebug logic of the CM4
- latency from release of hard reset to release of soft reset - 25 MCLK (@3MHz)

- sources:

  o (0) SYSRESETREQ
  o (1) WDT_A Timeout (may be mapped to either Soft or Hard reset)
  o (2) WDT_A Password violation
  o (3) FLCTL
  o (4) OverWatch request
  o (14) CS  - will these ever show up?
  o (15) PCM - will these ever show up?

** Class 3 - Soft Reset

- reset only the execution component of the system (ie. Core) and WDT_A
- does NOT reset any peripherals and system components.
- latency from release of soft reset to first CPU instruction fetch - 5 MCLK (@3MHz)

- sources:

  o (0) CPU Lockup
  o (1) WDT_A Timeout
  o (2) WDT_A Password violation


We use HardReset for OverWatch reseting.  And capture any of the other HardReset
sources.  This is communicated through the overwatch control block via
hard_reset.

When the system reboots after a reset any hard_resets are captured in hard_reset
along with the indicated reboot_reason.  These are then written into the
Reboot record recorded by the mmSync module.
