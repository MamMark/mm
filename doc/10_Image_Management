ImageManager and Image Management

1. Purpose

The ImageManager is responsible for managing the Image Region.  This region
holds some number of Tag executables, pure binaries that can be loaded into
the NIB region of the Tag's main processor flash.

Images are currently sized at 128KiB maximum.  This is half of the flash
area of the current cpu.  This is also much larger that the available RAM
on the processor.  Before starting an update of the flash it is imperative
to verify the integrity of the image.  This implies that one needs to see
the entire image and have it available for access prior to actually
programming the on-chip flash.  In other words we need to have some place
to stash the entire image before programming the flash with it.  The
ImageManager provides such a place for said stashage.

Images are explicitly simple binary images extracted from the more
complicated ELF output executables produced by the toolchain.  They are
an exact binary representation of the binary data needed to run the
executable.  The file extension ".bin" is used for these images.


ImageManager is the on board entity responsbile for the following:

o management of the space and ancilliary structures needed for said management.
o maintenance of the IM directory.  which slots are full etc.
o allocation and writing of a slot
o ejection of an active image
o deletion of a slot
o maintanence of Active/Backup slots.


2. Resources

ImageManager resources live exclusively within the Image Region.  This
region can be obtained by a call to FileSystem.area_{start,end}(FS_LOC_IMAGE).
FS_LOC_IMAGE indicates we want the information for the Image region.

These calls will return with the absolute sector numbers for the Image region.
One should never ever write outside of these start/end bounds.

The ImageManager directory is the first block (sector) of the Image Region.  It
contains protection information and n directory slots.  Each slot contains the
version identifier, the starting sector, and the state of the slot.


3. Organization

The image region is layed out thusly:


       +---------------------+
       |      Directory      |  <---- start
       |                     |
       |                     |
       |                     |
       +---------------------+
       |       Slot 0        |        start + 1 + S_n * 256
       |                     |        S_n = 0
       |                     |
       |                     |
       +---------------------+
       |       Slot 1        |        start + 1 + S_n * 256
       |                     |        S_n = 1
       |                     |
       |                     |
       +---------------------+
       |       Slot 2        |        start + 1 + S_n * 256
       |                     |        S_n = 2
       |                     |
       |                     |
       +---------------------+
       |       Slot 3        |        start + 1 + S_n * 256
       |                     |        S_n = 3
       |                     |
       |                     |  <---- end
       +---------------------+


Each slot can hold one maximally sized image.  (currently 128KiB,
128 * 1024 Bytes).  This translates into 256 512 Byte sectors.


4. Image Naming

Images are identified by a unique version number (manually managed).  This
version identifier is composed of 3 parts, a major (1 byte), a minor (1
byte), and buildnum (2 bytes).  Routines are provided by ImageManager for
accessing and manipulating this object type.

If two images have the same ver_id, then it is imperative that these images
are exact copies of each other.  If one sums their binary values the result
should be exactly the same.  It is up to the development community to
guarantee that this condition is met.  The ImageManager and all associated
software assumes that the two images with the same ver_id are indeed the
same images.  (Note, checksums of various flavors, including on image
checksums (see section 5) can be used to differentiate two images that
inadvertantly named the same ver_id).


5. Hardware Version

An image is built for a particular instantiation.  The image is marked
with the h/w model and h/w revision (model most significant) for which
this image is built.


6. Image Validity

There are two simple checksums associated with an image, a vector checksum
(vector_chk) and an image checksum (image_chk).

Both checksums assume the image starts on a quad aligned boundary (they do)
and any residual bytes at the end are padded with zeros to the next quad
boundary.  The checksum is a simple quad addition with no overflow.  The
resultant sum should be zero.

The vector sum is the sum over the initial vector table which is at the
start of the image (required).  This area is exactly 140 bytes long and
is determined explicitly by the processor being used.  The result has to
be added to vec_sum from the image info (see section 6).  This result
must be 0 for a valid image.

The vector sum is provided for a simple and quick validity check when
either quickness or enough of the image isn't available.

The image sum is performed over the entire image and must yield 0 if the
image is valid.  The image check digits, image_sum, are already included in
the image.


7. Image Identification

A binary image by itself typically does not provide any information about
what the image contains.  With Tag images, we correct this deficit by
embedding identifying information with in the image.

This information includes the following:

o signature, image_info_sig, identifies that this is image_info

o image_start, load address of the image.  Where in the address space of
  the processor should this image be loaded.

o image_length, how long in bytes is this image.  Needed for both writing
  the image as well as computing the checksum.

o vector_chk, image_chk: checksums over the vector table and the entire
  image.  See below for comments on the checksum algorithm.

o ver_id.  The version identifier of this image.  This is the name of
  the image and is considered unique.

o descriptor0.  An ID_MAX (44) byte string that describes the tip of the
  main tree.  The main tree is currently gh:tp-freeforall/prod(tp-master).
  null terminated.

o descriptor1.  An ID_MAX (44) byte string that describes the tip of the
  aux tree.  This is the main MamMark tree and is currently
  gh:MamMark/mm(master).  null terminated.

o stamp_date: a 30 byte null terminated string which is the build data
  when this image was built.

o hw_ver.  A two byte, Model and Revision that identifies the h/w this
  image is built for.

    128KiB      114700


Note: We currently use a 32 bit checksum for performance to verify the
entire image.  Its performance is good enough (ie. fast enough) for now.

Included in the image is the image_info and its contents is verified by the
image checksum.

If we need to go to a faster method, ie. vector check, the image_info is no
longer verified by the checksum and we will need to revisit this.
