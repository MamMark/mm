Requirements
o each sensor to be able to provide last value for Radio access
o how to determine age of value retrieved
o ability to signal in some fashion that new data is available.

Questions:
o How and where to represent the sensor set
o what are the sensor ids and sensor names.
o how to make the regime dynamic?  Do we need dynamic or static (compiled in).

lowest level

sensor ids.   need to map these ids into something a user can use in some fashion.

regime: a set of sensors and associated periods.  Periods in ms granularity.


How to handle interrupt events from various sensors.

How to handle smart sensors?



Thoughts:

o Regime simply states which sensors are active.

o Each active sensor has some kind of configuration object that describes things about
  how the sensor should be configured.

o Stupid sensors (simple sensors) indicate what period and what data it provides.
