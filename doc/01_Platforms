MM3: msp430f1611 based prototype.  see tos/platforms/mm3/hardware.h
     for port mapping.

MM4: msp430f2618 varient.  Note that the 2618 has a form factor that
     is a drop in for the 1611.  Some of the pins map differently.
     Note that the pin out of the 2618 and the 1611 are very close and
     the 2618 is essentially a h/w drop in for the 1611.  The f/w
     needs to change somewhat to account for the h/w differences
     (primarily between the USARTs and USCIs).

MM5: is planned to be based on the msp430f5438A.  The 5438 has more
h/w than the 2618 and its pin out is significantly different than the
2618.


Differences between the mm3 and mm4:

1) the 2618 uses USCIs vs. USARTs in the 1611.  Need to translate
the SPI and UART code from USARTs to SPIs.  Is there a simple way in
place or is it better to have new modules and tweak the wiring.
Note that the serial stuff in tinyos for the msp430 assumes that
serial stuff is implemented using usarts and the various
procedures reflect this.  How to generalize?  Is it worth it?  How did
the z1 do it?


2) USART 1 (Serial and SPI) reassignment.

   The mm3 is based on the msp430f1611 which has two USARTs which can
   be programmed as either a UART or a SPI.  Given that there are 4
   functions that are needed requires multiplexing the h/w and control
   structures via arbiters.

   USART 0 (spi) dedicated to ADC.
   USART 1 (uart) used by direct serial.  (serial_mux)
   USART 1 (uart) gps (serial_mux)
   USART 1 (spi)  SD.


   The mm4 is based on the msp430f2618 which has 4 uscis.

   USCI A0 (uart) is dedicated to the direct serial.
   USCI A1 (uart) dedicated to the gps.
   USCI B0 (spi)  dedicated to the ADC.
   USCI B1 (spi)  dedicated to the SD.


3) Port/Pin modifications:

from mm3 (1611) -> to mm4 (2618)

tmp_on:  p3.4 -> p3.0

              -> p3.4 (gps_txd)
	      -> p3.5 (gps_rxd)
	     
adc_sdi: p3.5 -> p6.6 (adc_sdi)

ser_txd: p3.6 -> p3.6 (dock_txd)
ser_rxd: p3.7 -> p3.7 (dock_rxd)
