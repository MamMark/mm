mm6a: The mm6a is a major implementation of the tag using the TI MSP432
  processor.  The MSP432 is an ARM Cortex-M4F with various TI peripherals.
  Many of these peripherals are derived from the equivilent peripheral in
  the msp430f5438a.

  The 432 has the following advantages:

  o respectable Flash (256K)
  o more RAM (64K)
  o flat 4GB address space
  o ARM regularity
  o increased processing power.
  o full single precision floating point coprocessor.
  o AES256 encryption h/w accelerator

One of the problems that the ARM solves concerns addressing.  The MSP430 is
a 16 bit architecture that was expanded to 20 bits.  But the cheif problem
involved a hole in the address space at the top of the 16 bit address space
(for the vectors).  Progressing on the msp430 line would have eventually
required moving to a different tool chain (unverified).

Moving to the ARM processor avoided these problems.

MM5a: The MM5a is a major reimplementation using the msp430f5438a as
  the main processor.   The major benefit of the 5438 is more USCI
  ports which cuts down on the need for sharing (arbritration).
  The sensor set has also been majorly revamped.   See $(LOCAL_REPO)/
  tos/platforms/mm5a/hardware.h.   ie. gh:MamMark/mm(master)/tos/
  platforms/mm5a/hardware.h.

MM3: msp430f1611 based prototype.  see tos/platforms/mm3/hardware.h
  for port mapping.

MM4: msp430f2618 variant.  Note that the 2618 has a form factor that
  is a drop in for the 1611.  Some of the pins map differently.
  Note that the pin out of the 2618 and the 1611 are very close and
  the 2618 is essentially a h/w drop in for the 1611.  The f/w
  needs to change somewhat to account for the h/w differences
  (primarily between the USARTs and USCIs).


Development Platforms:

dev6a: a development platform using the MSP432 that allows building
  various subsystems for the mm6a.

exp5438_5t: a test platform based on the TI MSP-EXP430F5438 combined
  with various sensors.

exp5438_gps: TI MSP-EXP430F5438 wired with a gps module and the Si4463
  radio.

mm5t: a test platfrom based on the TI MSP-EXP430F5438 development board
  superseeded by exp5438_5t.  (deprecated).


The following is maintained for historical reference.   A difference between
the mm4 and mm5 has not been done.   Too many differences.  Same is true
for differences between the mm5 and the mm6.

The mm3 and mm4 were very close.   The 2618 was a drop in (pin for pin) for
the 1611 and the differences were minimal.

Differences between the mm3 and mm4:

1) the 2618 uses USCIs vs. USARTs in the 1611.  Need to translate
the SPI and UART code from USARTs to SPIs.  Is there a simple way in
place or is it better to have new modules and tweak the wiring.
Note that the serial stuff in tinyos for the msp430 assumes that
serial stuff is implemented using usarts and the various
procedures reflect this.  How to generalize?  Is it worth it?  How did
the z1 do it?


2) USART 1 (Serial and SPI) reassignment.

   The mm3 is based on the msp430f1611 which has two USARTs which can
   be programmed as either a UART or a SPI.  Given that there are 4
   functions that are needed requires multiplexing the h/w and control
   structures via arbiters.

   USART 0 (spi) dedicated to ADC.
   USART 1 (uart) used by direct serial.  (serial_mux)
   USART 1 (uart) gps (serial_mux)
   USART 1 (spi)  SD.


   The mm4 is based on the msp430f2618 which has 4 uscis.

   USCI A0 (uart) is dedicated to the direct serial.
   USCI A1 (uart) dedicated to the gps.
   USCI B0 (spi)  dedicated to the ADC.
   USCI B1 (spi)  dedicated to the SD.


3) Port/Pin modifications:

from mm3 (1611) -> to mm4 (2618)

tmp_on:  p3.4 -> p3.0

              -> p3.4 (gps_txd)
	      -> p3.5 (gps_rxd)

adc_sdi: p3.5 -> p6.6 (adc_sdi)

ser_txd: p3.6 -> p3.6 (dock_txd)
ser_rxd: p3.7 -> p3.7 (dock_rxd)
