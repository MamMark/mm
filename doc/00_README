This brief is written assuming that there is a common root directory,  we'll
call it mm_t2 and it is usually at the top level of a working directory.

1) OS Install.

Install the OS, Ubuntu (Xubuntu uses less resources) on the box.  Recommended is
Xubuntu 8.04 (LTS).  A simple install is fine and will take less time.  Current
ISO install images can be found at [http://xubuntu.com/get#hardy 8.04 ISO].


When the install is complete, boot the system, and use Synaptic or other package
manager ("apt-get install") to make sure the following packages are installed:

    build-essentials, stow, automake, autoconf, autobook, libtool, libc6-dev,
    git-core, git-daemon-run, git-doc, git-email, git-gui, gitk, gitmagic


2) We use GIT as the SCM.  Here are some pointers to get you started:

   Start here:   http://book.git-scm.com/2_setup_and_initialization.html
   Everyday GIT: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html
   Cheat Sheet:  http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/09/git-cheat-sheet.html
   SVN to GIT:   http://git-scm.com/course/svn.html
   GIT Book:     http://book.git-scm.com/


3) T2_MM3 tree checkout:  The t2_mm3 tree is a seperate t2 based
tree that has mm3 unique code to build the mm3 load.

    git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/t2_mm3.git (read only)

    cd ~/mm_t2				# cd to top working dir.
    git clone git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/t2_mm3.git
    cd t2_mm3

    this will create the directory ~/mm_t2/t2_mm3 and you will be on the master
    branch.  Which is where you want to be.

    Any patches etc should be emailed.  (Can be prepared with git-format-patch
    or git-log).


4) TinyOS 2.x tree checkout

The main tracking repo is at:

    git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/tinyos-2.x.git
        read-only, cire tracking repo that tracks hinrg t2, updated manually
	This also has the mm3 code, branched off the hinrg t2 mainline

Changes needed to build the mm3 tree can be obtained via the mm3_tip
branch on the cire/tinyos-2.x.git repo.

To obtain the current mm3_tip branch:

    cd ~/mm_t2
    mkdir t2_cur
    cd t2_cur
    git clone -v git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/tinyos-2.x.git
    cd tinyos-2.x
    git checkout -t origin/mm3_tip


5) Install TinyOS toolset (msp430, avr)

We want the tinyos toolset for the msp430 (telosb) and the avr (micaz, mica2).
Debian packages are available from Stanford.

Modify the repository list using Applications->System->Software_Sources to include:

    deb http://tinyos.stanford.edu/tinyos/dists/ubuntu/ hardy main


Install the following packages:

           avr-binutils-tinyos
           avrdude-tinyos
           avr-gcc-tinyos
           avr-libc-tinyos
           avr-tinyos
           avr-tinyos-base
           deputy-tinyos
           msp430-binutils-tinyos
           msp430-gcc-tinyos
           msp430-libc-tinyos
           msp430-tinyos
           msp430-tinyos-base
           nesc
           tinyos-base
           tinyos-tools


6) Modify PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Make sure your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH include /opt/msp430 and
/usr/msp430 as appropriate.

   M1="/opt/msp430"
   M2="/usr/msp430"
   export PATH="$PATH:$M1/bin:$M2/bin"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$M1/lib:$M2/lib:/usr/local/lib"


7) Set up build environment settings

The following environment variables must be set to build.

    TOSROOT
    TOSDIR
    MAKERULES
    CLASSPATH
    TOSMAKE_PATH

    for example:  working dir ~/mm_t2
  
  	#!/bin/sh
  
  	MOTECOM="serial@/dev/ttyS0:telosb"
  
  	TOSROOT=~/mm_t2/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x
  	TOSDIR=$TOSROOT/tos
  
  	MAMMARK_DIR="/home/joe/mm_t2/t2_mm3"
  	TOSMAKE_PATH="$TOSMAKE_PATH $MAMMARK_DIR/support/make"
  
  	M1="/opt/msp430"
  	M2="/usr/msp430"
  	PATH="$PATH:$M1/bin:$M2/bin"
  	LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$M1/lib:$M2/lib:/usr/local/lib"
  
  	MAN_PATH="$MAN_PATH:$M1/man:$M2/man"
  
  	MAKERULES=$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules
  	CLASSPATH=.:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
  
  	PYTHONPATH=$TOSROOT/support/sdk/python:$PYTHONPATH
  	PYTHONPATH=$M1/lib:$M1/bin:$M2/lib:$M2/bin:$PYTHONPATH
  	PYTHONPATH=$M1/lib/python2.3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
  	PYTHONPATH=$M2/lib/python2.3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
  
  	#LIBMSPGCC_PATH=$M1/lib:$M2/lib
  
  	export MAKERULES TOSDIR TOSROOT CLASSPATH PYTHONPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  	export LIBMSPGCC MOTECOM MAMMARK_DIR TOSMAKE_PATH


8) TI USB Jtag driver fix

[Needs Work], Where to grab the driver code from.

The TI USB driver, (ti_usb_3410_5052 in Ubuntu kernels prior to 2.6.29 is broken, note
the default driver from kernel.org is correct and given below, needs to be built for
the JTAG to function.

The TI USB JTAG pod is used for debugging MSP430 based motes such as the TelosB.  If you
aren't using the pod you don't need to fix the driver.

Initial Ubuntu 8.04 has a version of the ti_usb_3410_5052 driver (used to
talk to the MSP430 jtag pod) that is slightly modified from the standard
linux kernel available at kernel.org.  The standard kernel's version of the
ti serial driver works so we will just reinstall that.

  a) Expand t2_mm3/Added_Bits/mspfet_driver.zip.  (This will create the directory
     mspfet_driver).
  b) mspfet_driver/readme.txt has more information.  Read them.  It is good.
  c) make
  d) temporarily install the new driver.

      /build/buildd/linux-2.6.24/drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for TI USB 3410 1 port adapter
      /build/buildd/linux-2.6.24/drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for TI USB 5052 2 port adapter
      usbcore: registered new interface driver ti_usb_3410_5052
      /home/joe/Desktop/mspfet_driver/ti_usb_3410_5052.c: TI USB 3410/5052 Serial Driver v0.9
      usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2
      usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
      ti_usb_3410_5052 1-2:1.0: TI USB 3410 1 port adapter converter detected
      usb 1-2: reset full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2
      usb 1-2: device firmware changed
      ti_usb_3410_5052: probe of 1-2:1.0 failed with error -5
      usb 1-2: USB disconnect, address 2
      usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 3
      usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 2 choices
      ti_usb_3410_5052 1-2:1.0: TI USB 3410 1 port adapter converter detected
      ti_usb_3410_5052: probe of 1-2:1.0 failed with error -5
      ti_usb_3410_5052 1-2:2.0: TI USB 3410 1 port adapter converter detected
      usb 1-2: TI USB 3410 1 port adapter converter now attached to ttyUSB0

  e) run "lsusb" which should look something like the following:
  
         m-tag (19): lsusb
         Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
         Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
         Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0451:f430 Texas Instruments, Inc. MSP-FET430UIF JTAG Tool
         Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
         m-tag (20):


  f) Make our new version of the ti serial driver permanent.
     1st make a back up of the originally installed driver
     (/lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ti_usb_3410_5052.ko)
  
     ie:
      modprobe -r ti_usb_3410_5052
      cd /lib/modules/2.6.24-19-generic/kernel/drivers/usb/serial
      cp ti_usb_3410_5052.ko ti_usb_3410_5052.ko_old
      cp ~/mm_t2/t2_mm3/Added_Bits/mspfet_driver/ti_usb_3410_5052.ko .
      modprobe ti_usb_3410_5052
  
NOTE: It is possible for the correct driver to get replaced if the system is
updated.  This occurs when any kernel packages are updated.  When this occurs
the permanent copy must be done again.


9) USB Jtag, /dev/ttyUSBn config 2, permissions fix

[Needs work], Where to grab the driver from

We also want to install a udev rule that will correctly enable configuration 2
of the jtag pod (this makes it work).  We also modify the permission rule so that
group user can access the jtag pod.  Files exist in the msp430fet_driver directory.

   a) Install the 40-ti-usb-3410-5052.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d.
  
      cp 40-ti-usb-3410-5052.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
      mkdir -p /etc/udev/scripts
      cp msp430_init /etc/udev/scripts
  
   b) make the following change in /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules
  
   change:
  
       SUBSYSTEM=="tty",                        GROUP="dialout"
  
   to:
  
       SUBSYSTEM=="tty",                        GROUP="users", MODE="0660"
  
  
   Make sure that any users that will be using the device are in group "users".


10) Install gdb and msp430-jtag from temporary location

[Needs work] where to stash the packages.

   *** These need to be put into a hardy debian package, they will be ***
   *** included in the tinyos-optional (msp430 flavor)                ***

   a) cd ~/mm_t2  (remember to be enabled, sudo)
   b) cd t2_mm3/Added_Bits/tools
   c) make install

   This should install into /opt/msp430/bin gdb.430 (the msp430-gdb debugger),
   msp430-jtag and some other tools.  Appropriate libraries are installed into
   /opt/msp430/lib.


11) Build SerialForwarder and libmote library.

    Build the serial forwarder and associated library (also includes direct serial access)

      cd $TOSROOT/support/sdk/c/sf
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/stow/sf_c
      make

      sudo -s
      make install

      ("sudo make install" for some reason doesn't pick up the value of $TOSROOT properly so
      the make install doesn't work write unless you are root first)

      This will install bin/{sf, sflisten, sfsend, seriallisten, serialsend}, include/{message.h,
      serialsource.h, sfsource.h}, and lib/libmote.a.  These will be installed into /opt/stow/sf_c.


   Install into /opt/{bin,include,lib} using stow.

      cd /opt/stow
      stow sf_c


12) Using the serialforwarder/seriallistener

    a) make sure that tinyos.jar has been built.  It should live in $TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
    b) to rebuild:
  
       cd $TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/
       make tinyos.jar
  
    c) Install TOSComm JNI support if needed.  Did java bitch about not finding TOSComm JNI support?
  
       assuming tinyos-tools is installed run:
  
       tos-install-jni
  
    d) To watch raw bytes coming from the serial port
  
       Make sure CLASSPATH includes $TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar, ie:
  
           CLASSPATH=.:/home/joe/mm_t2/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar

execute:

       java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb


And you should see packets that look something like this:  (depends on what the mote is sending)

            00 FF FF 00 00 12 00 21 00 12 07 09 00 0C 9E 23 00 0C 9E 30 F6 2C FF D7 FF FF
            00 FF FF 00 00 12 00 21 00 12 07 05 00 0C 9E 24 00 0C 9E 3F E5 AF B1 6F 9E D4
            00 FF FF 00 00 0E 00 21 00 0E 07 06 00 0C 9E 33 00 0C 9E 46 78 80
            00 FF FF 00 00 0E 00 21 00 0E 07 07 00 0C 9E 33 00 0C 9E 52 FF FF
            00 FF FF 00 00 10 00 21 00 10 07 08 00 0C 9E 33 00 0C 9E 61 FF FF FF FF
  
            00 FF FF 00 00 10 00 21 00 10 07 08 00 0C 9E 33 00 0C 9E 61 FF FF FF FF
            ^  ^     ^     ^  ^  ^  ^     ^  ^  | -- sensor 8 data
            |  |     |     |  |  |  |     |  |- sensor id
            |  |     |     |  |  |  |     |- sensor data type
            |  |     |     |  |  |  |-- length of data block
            |  |     |     |  |  |-- AM type MM3_DATA
            |  |     |     |  |-- AM group
            |  |     |     |-- serial length
            |  |     |-- src addr           
            |  |-- dest addr
            |-- dispatch byte - 0 says AM
                             
If you define MOTECOM you won't need to specify the -comm parameter.  ie:

       MOTECOM=serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb


13) Do a test compile and gdb run.  This assumes that the JTAG pod is connected to ttyUSB0.

    If you have mm3 hardware:

    cd ~/mm_t2/t2_mm3/apps/mm3
    make debug mm3 threads
    msp430-jtag -l /dev/ttyUSB0 -e build/mm3/main.exe

    from a different window run:

    msp430-gdbproxy msp430 /dev/ttyUSB0


    There should be a .gdbinit file in apps/mm3 which contains the following lines at the top:

        set remoteaddresssize 0d64
        set remotetimeout 0d999999
        target remote localhost:2000

    change into build/mm3/ and create a symbolic link to the .gdbinit file in the upper directory.
    This prevents the .gdbinit file from being wiped if one does make clean.

        pushd build/mm3
	ln -s ../../.gdbinit
	popd

    now if you run gdb.430 build/mm3/main.exe  gdb should connect to the proxy and start
    to debug your code in the device.  To let the device run use 'c', continue.  Do not use
    'run'.


14) Do a test compile and gdb run from the main tree.

    If you have telosb hardware:

    cd ~/mm_t2/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x/apps/Blink
    make debug telosb
    msp430-jtag -l /dev/ttyUSB0 -e build/telosb/main.exe


    from a different window run:

    msp430-gdbproxy msp430 /dev/ttyUSB0


    Make sure that you have a .gdbinit file in the app directory and the symbolic link
    from the build/telosb directory as described in 13.

    run gdb as described in 13.
