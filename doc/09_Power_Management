CPU Operating Modes:

AM      Active Mode     All clocks, devices running.
        AM_LDO_VCORE0   AM_DCDC_VCORE0          12/24MHz
        AM_LDO_VCORE1   AM_DCDC_VCORE1          24/48MHz
LPM0    SLEEP           processor is halted.
LPM3    DEEPSLEEP       only 32KiHz LFXT allowed to function.
        only RTC and WDT can be clocking.  No timers.
        retains peripheral state.
LPM3.5  all peripherals except RTC and WDT are disabled and powered down.
        no peripheral state is retained.  Bank0/SRAM is retained and
        device I/O pin states are latched and retained.
LPM4    no clocks
LPM4.5  no clocks.  Same as 3.5 and no SRAM or peripheral register
        data is not retained.  VCORE is OFF.

We use AM (ON), LPM0 (SLEEP), and LPM3 (DEEPSLEEP).

When going into DEEPSLEEP, one must set SCR.SLEEPDEEP to a 1 before
executing the WFE or WFI.


Current consumption, LDO-Based LPM0 Modes
2.2V, 16MHz Vcore0/1, 32MHz Vcore1, 48MHz Vcore1
     590/735 640/820     965/1160    1235/1450

LPM0 is where the CPU sleeps.  ==> 16MiHz.

DCDC-Based LPM0 Modes
2.2V, 16MHz Vcore0/1, 32MHz Vcore1, 48MHz Vcore1
     485/600 555/710     810/970     1020/1200

LF LPM0
2.2V, MCLK, HSMCLK, SMCLK, sourced by REFO @ 128KHz
I_lpm0_lf_vcore0 58-94uA, max 180uA
I_lpm0_lf_vcore1 60-104uA, max 220uA

===> seems to argue for switching to LF when going to sleep


Transition Timing

- t_off_amldo0, power off to AM_LDO_VCORE0, 6ms
- t_amldo0_amldo1, AM_LDO_VCORE0 to AM_LDO_VCORE1,  300-350s
- t_amldo1_amldo0, AM_LDO_VCORE1 to AM_LDO_VCORE0,    4-5s
- t_amldo0_amdcdc0, AM_LDO_VCORE0 to AM_DCDC_VCORE0, 20-30s
- t_amdcdc0_amldo0, AM_DCDC_VCORE0 to AM_LDO_VCORE0, 10-15s
- t_amldo1_amdcdc1, AM_LDO_VCORE1 to AM_DCDC_VCORE1, 20-30s

- t_amldo0_lpm30, AM_LDO_VCORE0 to LPM3_VCORE0,      22-24s
- t_lpm30_amldo0, LPM3_VCORE0 to AM_LDO_VCORE0,       8-9s

- t_lpm31_amldo1, LPM3_VCORE1 to AM_LDO_VCORE1,       8s


Power Supply System (PSS)

- 1.65V required for start-up
- Pwr On/Off via VCCDET
- SVSMH/Vcc, Supply Voltage Superviser and Monitor High Side.
- Power-fail indicators via RSTCTL registers.
- SVSMH can be turned off for low power situations
- SVSMH can interrupt (what we should do) or cause a reset.
- SVSMHTH bits set the threshold.  (has hysteresis)

Power Control Manager (PCM)


Reset Controller (RSTCTL)
