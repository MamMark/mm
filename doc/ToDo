In no particular order:

5) GPS SirfIII binary mode.

6) GPS SirfIII different baud rate

7) interrupts being turned off when gps releases and requests and something
   else needs it.  (SD?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

0) look at SpiPacket at 2MHz not working vs. 500KHz.  look at email t2-devel folder.

1) Look at Power

2) SD to DMA (use DMA, need DMA interrupt vector)
2.1) figure out SpiPacket  problem, non-dma
2.2) figure out SpiPacket (dma) not getting completion interrupt.

3) SD kernel for when things go wrong.  Panic write to SD.

4) ADC timing  verify.

8) Different failure modes.
   . basic fall back. how many times to retry the SD before giving up.
   . basic comm mode.  Nothing else running?

9) check GPS power off, SD power off, tri-state stuff?

10) Investigate GPS power up.  What state does it come up in?  How to
    put into binary mode.  How to change baud rate.

11) check out s/w uart interrupt.
    check out timer assisted s/w/ uart.

12) Verify milli timer behaviour far into the future.  How do wraps work?

13) watchdog design.  How to detect when things stop?  Sensing.  If sensing is
    supposed to happen who watches.  Regime Control knows what is supposed to
    run.  It can wake up every now and then and check to see if the sensors
    have done their thing during the interval.

14) Timeouts on SD behaviour.

15) With a scope verify
    a) DCO timing
    b) TMilli
    c) T32KHz
    d) TMicro

*7) GPS p1.3 s/w uart. (abandoned)
