Record Managment

Definitions:

alignment:      initial byte alignment for a multibyte datum or structure
                can be half-word, word/quad, double-quad aligned.
granualrity:    ending alignment for a multibyte datum or structure.
byte:           8 bit quantity
half-word:      16 bit quantity, 2 bytes.
word:           32 bit quantity
quad:           32 bit quantity, alias of word.  4 bytes.
quad alignment: the datum or structure is aligned on a quad word (low two bits 0)
quad granular:  the structure or datum ends evenly aligned wrt the next quad.

dblk:           short for data block.
data block:     another name for a record.
typed_data:     yet another name for a record.
file_offset:    absolute byte offset of a record from the start of the DBLK file.
blk_id:         absolute sector/block id of a 512 byte sector on the SD.
sector:         512 byte data block used to talk to the SD.
SD:             Secure Digital device that is the effective mass storage device.


SysTime:
DateTime:


Restrictions:

o record headers (dt_header_t)
** quad alignment.  All record headers are required to start with quad alignment.
** quad granularity.  All record headers are required to be a multiple of 4 bytes.
** all record headers must fit contiguously in a sector's remaining available space.

o Time
** Datetime is monotonically increasing since file inception.
** Systime is monotonically increasing since last REBOOT.


DBLK directory

o File Inception.  When a tagsd is formatted, the DBLK file is created.  The creation
  data is inserted into the DBLK directory.  It provides the base for monotonically
  increasing datetime.
o File limits.  blk_low, blk_high.  Blk_ids.  These are needed for converting from
  absolute sector numbers to file offsets relative to the beginning of the file.
