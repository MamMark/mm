Things to talk to Kevin about:

-2) Time out for SD code.  How to?

-1) Need to work on syncronization between Task level and Thread level
    How to avoid a race condition when task signals a buffer is ready
    (buf_state goes full) and the thread spinning and looking for
    work.  Corner case when the thread sees no more work just as the
    task signals.

0) In StreamStorageP, in ResourceConfigure.configure is async and
   needs atomic ss_state = SS_STATE_IDLE;  while async ResourceConfigure.unconfigure
   doesn't need the atomic?  what gives?

1) Details of Mutex and Condvars

1.5) default commands?  How are they used?  see mm3ControlP.nc

2) get Kevin to how me how to mess with stow

3) Default owner of comm.  So listening works....  LPL?  serial etc.

4) Basic  command structure.

6) At some point review timer A usage.  Where should it get powered
   up and where get powered down.

   When should it get resync'd to Aclk?


*-1) wiring in a different msp430ClockInit rather then the override
    in PlatformP.nc.
*0) wiring in dma for sd
*2) How to wire in a different configurator.  Need to do this because
   we phutz with input/output pins because of the power issue.

   Note currently the default configurator and the defaultowner
   configurator do things to the SPI io pins which get in our way.
*5) GPS.  custom interrupt for s/w uart.


Installation of Tools.
Configuring Linux Kernel for ti usb fet
Other Misc. things.

1) udev configuration
   see ~/tinyos/Downloads/36-MSP430-FET.rules

Loading:

modprobe ti_usb_3410_5052 vendor_3410=0x1234,0x1234 product_3410=0x1111,0x2222

    Alternatively, you could add this line to /etc/modules.conf

       add options ti_usb_3410_5052 vendor_3410=0x1234,0x1234 product_3410=0x1111,0x2222

including the echo 2 > /sys/bus/usb/.../bConfigurationValue step, by
adding this udev rule:

[andyw@ermintrude ~]$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/msp-fet430uif.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device" ACTION=="add" SYSFS{product}=="MSP-FET430UIF JTAG Tool"
  SYSFS{bNumConfigurations}=="2"
  SYSFS{bConfigurationValue}=="1"
  RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 2 > /sys%p/device/bConfigurationValue'", MODE="0666"
[andyw@ermintrude ~]$
