Things to talk to Kevin about:

-2) Time out for SD code.  How to?

-1) Need to work on syncronization between Task level and Thread level
    How to avoid a race condition when task signals a buffer is ready
    (buf_state goes full) and the thread spinning and looking for
    work.  Corner case when the thread sees no more work just as the
    task signals.

0) In StreamStorageP, in ResourceConfigure.configure is async and
   needs atomic ss_state = SS_STATE_IDLE;  while async ResourceConfigure.unconfigure
   doesn't need the atomic?  what gives?

1) Details of Mutex and Condvars

1.5) default commands?  How are they used?  see mm3ControlP.nc

2) get Kevin to show me how to mess with stow

3) Default owner of comm.  So listening works....  LPL?  serial etc.

4) Basic  command structure.

6) At some point review timer A usage.  Where should it get powered
   up and where get powered down.

   When should it get resync'd to Aclk?

8) Comment on loss of Overrun and other possible interrupts because
   of how the interrupt handler works.

9) Capture Control (Msp430TimerCapComP) doesn't work.  see DOESNT_WORK define.

Syncing rules:

0) run cvs upd to get list of files changed, modified, and patched.
   save to a file for later reference.

1) run cvs diff to a file.  (cvs on t2 tree)

2) note which files have been changed.  Will have to look at changes
   from the tree vs. changes I've made.

3) check changes from external trees that have been brought in.


byte times:

115200 bits/sec    10bits  *  secs/115200 = 8.681e-5  ~87us
57600  bits/sec    10bits  *  secs/57600  = 1.736e-4  ~174us



*-1) wiring in a different msp430ClockInit rather then the override
    in PlatformP.nc.
*0) wiring in dma for sd
*2) How to wire in a different configurator.  Need to do this because
   we phutz with input/output pins because of the power issue.

   Note currently the default configurator and the defaultowner
   configurator do things to the SPI io pins which get in our way.

I guess you are asking this because you don't "see" the device showing up.
You might need to set some UDEV rules, see:
<http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~npreyss/msp430/>
<ftp://ftp.fl.priv.at/pub/msp430/ez430/ez430-on-SuSE-10.2.txt>

The EZ430 is identical to the USB JTAG FET when it comes to drive
initialization.

Yes, but on the first run you have to update the firmware of the usb jtag
pod, then you can run it normally.

problem with mspgcc lib from msp430-jtag
by cire Nov 04, 2007; 10:38pm :: Rate this Message: - Use ratings to moderate (?)

I recently downloaded the tinyos 2.x XubunTOS live CD and installed it.  Which
uses the mspgcc tool chain.  I got jtag from the stanford repository.  (msp430tools-jtag-lib-tinyos)
and (msp430tools-python-tools-tinyos).

It installed okay and I built Blink (one of the tinyOS demo programs).  So far
the only problem I've run into is when I try to run "msp430-jtag".  I get the
following error:

cire-laptop (45): msp430-jtag
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/msp430/bin/msp430-jtag", line 16, in <module>

OSError: MSP430mspgcc: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
cire-laptop (46):

The question is how does python find libraries?  In particular how does the line
"MSP430mspgcc = ctypes.cdll.MSP430mspgcc" into a shared object (library).

I've looked for any files in the /opt hierarchy and found the following:

/opt/msp430/lib/libMSP430mspgcc.a
/opt/msp430/lib/libMSP430mspgcc.so

I've set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include /opt/msp430/lib and have run ldconfig.
But it still can't find the library.

the part of the implementation that you posted indicated that they are
using older source code.

i had problems with this. later versions of jtag.py use the envirionment

ti usb jtag problem.
by cire Mar 12, 2008; 02:09pm :: Rate this Message: - Use ratings to moderate (?)

I just got a TI USB Jtag (msp-fet430uif) debugging interface to replace an old parallel port
one.  The kernel is finding it but no /dev/ttyUSB* device file is being created.

Any thoughts?  Anyone know what error -5 coming from the device driver means
(ti_usb_3410_5052: probe of 1-1:1.0 failed with error -5).

Below is relavant info:

Did you install the udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d?

by the way, I added this to the udev rule:

# Use the tty subsystem to get a stable name for the FET
  SUBSYSTEM=="tty" ACTION=="add"\
  SYSFS{product}=="MSP-FET430UIF JTAG Tool" \
  SYMLINK+="ttyTIUSB"

then a symlink is automatically created at /dev/ttyTIUSB.  I have a
lot of USB->serial adapters and it seems like the FET tool never gets
the same device file name.  This way, I can put "/dev/ttyTIUSB" in my
Makefile and never have to worry about it.

Mark

Yup, I'm pretty sure that's the problem.  Searching the list
for udev will probably turn up the relevent threads.

That's an excellent tip, though I recently ended up with two
USB-serial based widgets both based on the same chip (IIRC, the
pl2303), and the flippin' vendors didn't bother to modify any
of the default values, so they both show up as generic PL2303
serial ports and there's no way for udev to tell them apart. :/

Re: [Mspgcc-users] MSP-FET430UIF on linux
From: Stephen Glow <sglow@em...> - 2008-06-05 11:20
Hi Jim;

I tackled getting this working in Ubuntu 8.04 a couple weeks ago. I
found at that time that the driver that ships with the Ubuntu kernel has
a problem with the TI FET device. At that time I put together a small
.zip file with a working driver (taken from the vanilla kernel on
kernel.org) which does work. I posted it to my web site here:
http://www.embeddedintelligence.com/mspfet_driver.zip

Since that time I've seen a message posted to this list indicating that
a kernel update on Ubuntu may have already fixed this problem. I
haven't played with the device since then, so I can't personally confirm
this.

Even if the driver that came with your kernel does work, you will still
need a udev rule to select the proper configuration. Until this happens
you won't get the needed /dev/ttyUSB0 device file. As a test, you can
manually perform the same action that this rule does to see if the
driver that you are currently using supports the device.

First, unplug the device and plug it back in. Then, use the dmesg
command to find the location of the device's directory that was created
under the /sys file system. What you are looking for is a file called
'bConfigurationValue' under the directory of the proper device in the
/sys directory tree. I don't have my emulator handy to check this, but
I think it should be something like:
/sys/bus/usb/devices/something/bConfigurationValue

Once you find this file, enter the following command (using the correct
file name of course):

sudo echo 2 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/something/bConfigurationValue

If the driver you have loaded supports this device, then the
/dev/ttyUSB0 file will be magically created when you enter this.

A udev rule which handles this detail is included in the .zip I
referenced above. Even if you don't need the driver included in the
.zip, you may find this handy.

Rgds,
Steve
