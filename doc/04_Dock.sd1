The Dock is a field deployable device intended to make infield transfer of
data on and off the MM series tags.  A mm6a tag plugs into the dock.  A
full sized SD or uSD with adapter can also be plugged into the appropriate
slot (DOCK_SD1).  The user then has several simple commands that can cause
the tag/dock to transfer data.  It is intended to be simple and robust for
field work.

The Dock interface to the local processor is severely limited due to pin I/O
constrainsts.  There is a 4 wire SPI interface for access to the DOCK_SD
(SD1) and two additional IOs, dock_io_0 (connected to S0) and dock_io_1
(connected to S1).

The Dock has the following User Interface elements:

o two 3 position switches, S0 and S1.  The normal position is no connection
  (N).  Up corresponds to 1 and Down to 0.  So a switch state could be
  for example S0N/S1N, S0U/S1NC, S0D/S1D.

o 4 Leds, D1-D4.  D1 and D2 are controlled by S0/dock_io_0.  Similarily
  D3 and D4 are controlled by S1/dock_io_1.


Operation:

S0C and S1C are the common connectors on each switch.  The voltage at this
node can be controlled by either the switch or the processor pin.  The
switch takes priority.  The switch can be in one of three positions, no
connection (NC, N), grounded (D), or connected to V+ (U).

The processor pins, dock_io_0 and _1, are also connected to S0C and S1C.
These pins can be used to sense the state of a switch (U, D, or N) and
can also effect the state of the LEDs.


Sensing a switch position:

To sense a switch the processor pin must be an input.  We then observe the
following result:

    switch      Port      Sense
              Resistor
      NC         PU         1
      NC         PD         0   -> NC (-1)
      UP         PU         1
      UP         PD         1   -> UP (1)
     DOWN        PU         0
     DOWN        PD         0   -> DOWN (0)


LED Operation:

There are four LEDS, D1/D2 associated with S0 and dock_io_0 and D3/D4
associated with S1 and dock_io_1.  For a given pair we can have 3 different
states, upper on, both off, and lower on.  Just like the switch we can
describe the LED that is on when the switch is in the upper position as
the upper LED.

    S0D -> D1 lit (D1 is L0D)
    S0U -> D2 lit (D2 is L0U)
    S1D -> D3 lit (D3 is L1D)
    S1U -> D4 lit (D4 is L1U)


In addition to the switches, the LEDs can be controlled by the state
of dock_io_0 and dock_io_1 (pins coming from the local processor).  If
the processor wants to illuminate L1U it can switch dock_io_1 to
output and drive it to a 1.   This will illuminate L1U (unless S1 is
in the down position).  Switches always override what the processor
is outputting.


Switch/LED arrangement:

    L0U (D2)    L1U (D4)


      U           U
    S0 N        S1 N
      D           D


    L0D (D1)    L1D (D3)


LED signalling:

We use various patterns using the LEDs to signify different kinds
of feedback to the user.

o Basic acknowledge, LED_CIRCLE_CW.   This is a clockwise circle,
flashing each LED long enough so it looks like a rotating circle
is occuring.

o Flash.  All four LEDS are turned on effectively at the same time.
  Since we can't turn on both L0U and L0D at the same time.  We use
  visual persistence to make it look like all 4 LEDs are being turned
  on at the same time.

  Flash-2 means,  Flash, slight pause, Flash.

o Pause.  All LEDs off for an appropriate period of time.


Entering Dock Mode:

Dock Mode is an operational mode of the LocalProcessor (the msp432 on the
mm6a h/w).  Simply plugging the tag h/w into the dock does not notify the
LocalProcessor to enter dock mode.

Dock mode can be entered from either LowPowerMode (Chirp) or from
NormalPowerMode.  This occurs when S0 is thrown into S0U.  This will
generate an interrupt on dock_io_0.  This interrupt handler will then
generate a system_quiesce signal that should eventually result in
entering Dock Mode.

Hold S0U for count of 5.   L0U will be on.

Enter Dock Mode.  Acknowledge Dock Mode to User.  Circle.

User releases S0U.  LP finishes Circle.


Offload:  The user wishes to copy all data on the tag up to a blank
SD in the DOCK_SD socket.

User inserts a blank SD card into DOCK_SD.

User holds both switches up (S0U/S1U) for count of 5.
  Ack, Circle. Pause.

LP checks SD1.

   no device present (ie. failed initilization)   -> Flash-5
   device present, too small, etc.                -> Flash-5
   device present, not erased (something in MBR)  -> Flash-3
   device present, erased                         -> Flash-1

   user can proceed from Flash-3 or Flash-1.


Command Abort:  User holds S0U (S0U/S1N) for count of 5.

Proceed:  User holds S0U/S1U for count of 5.

Ack: Circle.


if SD1 is not erased.  Erase SD1, give progress indicator.

Flash-2 to indicate starting copy.

LP starts copy.  We want a progress indicator.  Slow circle.

Completion of the copy.  LP indicates completion by Circle,
Pause, Status, Pause ...  repeat.

Status will be Flash-2 for success.   Flash-5 for failure.

User acknowledges completion with S0U.  Circle.


Onload: The user wishes to copy a properly formatted SD from
SD1 to the onboard SD.

User puts properly formatted SD into DOCK_SD.

User holds both switches down (S0D/S1D) for count of 5.
Circle acknowledge.

Error check: wrong size, no SD1 device  -> Flash-5

Flash-1 asking to proceed.

Proceed: S0D/S1D for count of 5.  Ack with Circle.
Abort:   S0U count of 5, circle ack.

User commands proceed by S0D/S1D for count of 5.
circle ack.

progress indicator.

Same completion as Offload.



Leaving Dock Mode:

Simply unplugging the tag from the dock will NOT cause the LP to leave
dock mode.

Plan B method:  Anytime in dock mode we will have a background timer
running.  When this timer expires, we will leave dock mode.

Plan A: User commands leaving dock mode via S0D/S1N for count of 5,
circle ack.  Leave dock mode.


Command Summary:

S0U/S1U:        Offload copy up from tag to SD1
S0D/S1D:        Onload  copy down from SD1 to tag.
S0D/S1U:        Excute a run script.
S0D/S1N:        Undock.
