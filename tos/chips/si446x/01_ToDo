o try out unified fifo
o RSSI_LATCH int set when RSSI exceeds MODEM_RSSI_THRESH prop.  What to use it for?
o how do we program RSSI_LATCH?
o really need chip_pend in interrupt tracing

o add check for reasonable device_state in a_rx_on.
  check device state (must be READY) before we do a start_rx
o review getclr_int_status

o review exceptions again.  and exception gdb command


- Receive timing

  how long does SpiBlock.transfer actually take.  What is the
  timing for receiving bytes, can we keep the fifo empty?

  Only an issue for higher data rates, ie. > 800 Kbps.


- Transmit Power

- Timesync/Packet Timestamping (similar to CC2520-v2 SFD stuff)
- SFD/packeting timestamping

- Packet Handler usage

- > 63 byte packets.

  - one fifo 129 bytes long.   128 byte packets.  seems simplest.

    how does dumping the fifo work with a single fifo?  Size, how
    to see what's in it.  Non-transparent.

-> fifo control

   fifo_info command can clear the tx and rx fifos (don't do this
   when in TX or Rx (ie something happening).

   if fifo cmd sent without the fifo reset byte, what happens?


- TX turn around for ACK.  How long?

  TX -> RX takes 100uS once commanded.
  RX -> TX takes 100uS once commanded

  assumes Zero-IF mode is off.

- how to deal with CCA
  - how to detect
  - backoff algorithm

- what to dump from the radio?  everything?
  - main state
  - properties


*** Packet Length manipulations
  packet length.   See PKT_LEN_ADJUST.  Auto Packet Handler in use.
  LEN_ADJUST is added to len extracted from src_field,
  PKT_LEN_FIELD_SOURCE, tweaks DST_FIELD value in PKT_LEN property.

  by default, LEN_ADJUST 0, rx pkt len does not include pkt len bytes nor
  crc  bytes.

  packet length value returned by PACKET_INFO reflects the value extracted
  from the received packet prior to LEN_ADJUST adjustment.

  what does LEN_ADJUST actually modify?  what returns the result?  [LEN_ADJUST
  is added to the received value of the packet length extracted from the field
  specified by the SRC_FIELD value in the PKT_LEN_FIELD_SOURCE property. The
  resulting value is then used to configure the length of the variable length
  field specified by the DST_FIELD value in the PKT_LEN property.]

  [okay what does that mean?]

  also pkt len value stored in RX_FIFO (PKT_LEN:IN_FIFO must be set) also
  is a unadjusted value.

  see PACKET_INFO cmd, PKT_LEN, PKT_LEN_FIELD_SOURCE, PKT_LEN:DST_FIELD


--- Strange behaviour on POWER_UP with a stopping breakpoint
  [not reproducible]

  when a bp is put at AAA in DriverLayerP.n:cs_por_wait, after launch of
  the CMD_POWER_UP, the timeout at the start of cs_pwr_up_wait fails on
  the cts check.

  We also tried pulling CTS via CMD_READ_CMD_BUF on the SPI.  Doesn't
  change the behaviour.

  CTS should be set.  If we don't stop at the above nop, then CTS gets
  set properly.  Both with and without the CMD_READ_CMD_BUF.

  We need to understand what is going on and why it is behaving differently
  when stopping vs. not stopping.


*** Move platform dependent h/w pin definitions for Radio to Platform Si446x
  file when dumping radio h/w state.


*** Get_Properties has some strange results....

  after power-up, we grab all the properties and compare against defaults.
  some don't match.  Eh?

  gr00_global: all zeros, should be 40 00 18 20 00 00 01 60 00 00
