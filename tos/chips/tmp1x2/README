README for the tmp1x2 Driver

The tmp102 and tmp112 temperature sensor chips are very similar and this
driver supports both.  The tmp112 has an extended range.

From the tmp102/tmp112 datasheet:

When successful, the driver will return a word of data.  Depending on the
tmp102 configuration, the first 12 or 13 bits of that word will contain
a temperature value in Celsius degrees in the driver format.  One LSB corresponds
to 0.0625 degrees, which is 1/16 degree.

In 12 bit mode, the first byte contains a whole number of degrees and
the first four bits of the second byte contain a fractional degree.
To round off to whole degrees:  look at the four bits containing the fraction
and add one if they are greater than equal to 8.

Negative degree values are provided in twos complement form.

It should be possible to compress 16 bit temperature words to 8 bit when
what you need is accuracy to 1/2 degree.
