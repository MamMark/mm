README for the tmp1x2 Driver

The tmp102 and tmp112 temperature sensor chips are very similar and this
driver supports both.  The tmp112 has an extended range.

From the tmp102/tmp112 datasheet:

A resource arbiter control access to the bus and controls power to any tmp
sensors that are attached.

When a sensor is accessed, first a Resource.request must be done to a) turn
on the power and b) gain control of the I2C bus.

TMP sensors need 26 to 35 ms to do a conversion and this is true from when
power is first brought up.  Until the first conversion occurs, the sensor
will return 0 deg C.  So we have to wait.

Once granted, we read 16 bits from register 0 to get the temperature.
Afterwards we shut the sensor down (via SD) to minimize power until the bus
is turned off again.

Depending on the tmp102 configuration, the first 12 or 13 bits of the 16
bits will contain a temperature value in Celsius.  One LSB corresponds to
0.0625 degrees, which is 1/16 degree.

In 12 bit mode, the first byte contains a whole number of degrees and
the first four bits of the second byte contain a fractional degree.
To round off to whole degrees:  look at the four bits containing the fraction
and add one if they are greater than equal to 8.

Negative degree values are provided in twos complement form.

It should be possible to compress 16 bit temperature words to 8 bit when
what you need is accuracy to 1/2 degree.
