 * We've observed some strange SD timing where it takes
 * a really long time to write (which causes a timeout).
 * Normally we expect 3-5 mis for the write to happen so
 * a timeout of 120 mis seems plenty, but we've exceeded this
 * (conditions not understood).  A guess is the SD card is
 * actually doing a remapping of somekind which takes a bunch
 * of time.  Observed time of 190mis.
 *
 * This impacts the tag because the longer the SD is on the
 * more power it consumes.  So we want to see this condition
 * so we can possibly change things.
 *
 * Strategy is to log excess writes.  But use a long time out
 * for the real failure condition.
 *
 * Expected write time is about 3-5 mis.  Warning generated if
 * we take longer than 3*.  And the failure timeout is set
 * to 300 mis.  This is all fairly arbitrary.
