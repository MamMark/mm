Power Management:

  The main power bus is 1.8V (1V8 rail).   This bus is on all the time and
  powers the uP (5438a).

  There is also a 3.3V bus that is used to power the uSD and most of the
  analog circuitry.  This bus is powered from the 1.8V bus via a switching
  power supply.

  The radio system is powered by a switching regulator that can provide
  either 1.8V (for lower power) or 3.3V for high power transmission.

Temp

  Temp subsystem consists of one onboard and one external tmp102 (TI TMP102)
  temperature sensors.  The two temperature sensors are physically connected
  to UCSI B2 and communicates via I2C.

  Pins:
      TP14:  temp_pwr (via 1K)
      TP15:  temp_gnd
      TP16:  temp_sda
      TP17:  temp_scl

      P9.1:  temp_sda (ucb2sda)
      P9.2:  temp_scl (ucb2scl)
      P10.1: temp_pwr                 (0: off, 1: on)


  P10.1 must be 1 to power both temperature sensors.

  The onboard tmp102 uses address 0x48 (ADD0 grounded) while the external
  tmp102 uses address 0x49 (ADD0 connected to V+).

  Communications on this I2C bus occurs at 400KHz.  The power consumption of
  the tmp102 chips at 400KHz is 10-15uA vs 80-85uA at 3.4MHz.


Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)

  The ADC subsystem takes analog signals from several analog sources and
  converts them into corresponding digital values.  Included are the
  following sources:

    1) Salinity sensor
    2) Pressure Transducer
    3) Battery Voltage
    4) Solar Input

  Most of the analog circuitry requires the 3V3 power rail to be on
  (pwr_3v3_ena).

  The actual conversion is preformed by an ADS1148 analog to digital converter
  that lives on a dedicated SPI bus (UCSI B1).  The ads1148 has an internal
  8 input multiplex. In addition two MAX4782 dual 4-1 analog multiplexors are
  used in the system as well.

uSD - Storage System

  The uSD subsystem provides a single uSD module for mass storage.  Currently
  only up to 2GB can be used.  This is a sw driver issue (sd vs. sdhc
  protocols).

  Normally the 5438a uP is responsible for powering the uSD and accessing the
  contents.  The 5438a accesses the uSD using SPI mode only.

  The 5438a access the uSD via a dedicated UCSI (uca1) as a SPI master.

  Provisions have been made for direct access when the Tag is docked.  The
  dock brings out all 8 of the uSD pins and the uSD can be accessed using SD
  mode for higher speed access.

  When docked, a timer is started on the dock.  When this timer expires the
  dock will override the 5438a and take control directly of the uSD.  This
  will provide a failsafe mechanism for accessing the contents of the uSD.

  See Dock section for more information.

  Power and Voltage Levels:

    The uSD is powered 
    The uSD operates at 3.3V (3V3 rail on, pwr_3v3_ena) and  and needs the 3V3 rail turned on via pwr_3v3_ena.
    Logic level translation between the processor (5438a, 1.8v) and the uSD
    (3.3V) is done.

      P7.3:  usd_pwr_ena
      P8.2:  usd_csn

*** on the schematic there is a reference to "add sd power sense".  Do
    we need a sd power sense?  Probably not.

  5438a/uSD access protocol:  When ever the 5438a wants to access the uSD
  it must follow the following protocol.

  1) drive usd_access_ena_n low.

     if the dock hasn't disabled access, this will drive the OEn of U37 low
     enabling the 5438a to control the pins of the uSD.

  2) read usd_access_sense.  If the 5438a has control of the uSD then this
     signal will be low.  If the dock is overriding uSD access then this line
     will be high.

     [what should the software do if we have been kicked off the uSD?  This
     should eventually cause the same behaviour as seeing the docked signal]

  3) power the uSD up by asserting usd_pwr_ena



Dock Interface

  Pins:
      TP3:   docked
      TP11:  dock_mosi (dock -> 5438a) (uca0txd)
      TP12:  dock_clk
      TP13:  dock_usd_override
      TP27:  dock_miso (5438a -> dock) (uca0rxd)
      TP34:  1V8 rail Vdd
      TP35:  gnd

      P1.7:  dock_irq
      P3.0:  dock_clk   (dock supplied clock)
      P3.4:  dock_mosi  (dock -> 5438a)
      P3.5:  dock_miso  (dock <- 5438a)


  The Dock provides two interfaces to the mm5a tag, a) a communications port
  (dockcomm) and b) a direct uSD interface.

  The dockcomm port uses SPI to communicate between the Dock and the mm5a tag.
  The Dock provides a USB interface to the outside world that makes the
  mm5a tag look like a run of the mill USB serial port.  The Dock acts as
  an SPI master and the 5438a runs its SPI port as a slave.  A dedicated SPI
  port (uca0) running in slave mode is used on the 5438a side.
  
  Dock/uSD/5438a protocol:  When the mm5a tag is plugged into the dock, a
  mutual exclusion problem exists.  Both the 5438a and the dock may want to
  access the uSD at the same time.  This must be prevented.

  However, when first docked, the 5438a maybe in the middle of something and
  we want to give it a reasonable amount of time to complete.

  When docked, a signal is generated that informs the 5438a that a docking
  event has occured.  This should cause the 5438a to finish what it is doing
  and go into a docked mode.


  Dock Protocol:  When the mm5a is plugged into the dock the following occurs:

  1) When plugged in, docked (TP3) is driven high.  This causes an interrupt
     to be generated on the 5438a via dock_irq.

     dock_usd_override will be tristated.

  2) the dock starts a failsafe timer used to force dock control of the uSD if
     the timer expires.

*** So the dock can say "hey, I'm here" via docked/dock_irq.

    How does the 5438a tell the dock, great I'm in docked mode?

    One way is have the dock start to communicate on the dockcomm, asking for
    status.  The 5438a responds appropriately saying either (running, or docked).

    That should work.  Or do we want an pin coming back?

  dock_usd_override: when the dock wants to access the uSD, it drives this
  signal with a 1.  This disables any access of the mm5a 5438a processor to the
  uSD.



Radio Subsystem:

The mm5a has a transceiver that operates in the 433MHz frequency band for
wireless communications.  Communications between the 5438a and the si446X
is via a dedicated UCSI (uca2) running in SPI master mode.
