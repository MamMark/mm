 * The MM4 is clocked at 8MHz.  (could go up to 16MHz)
 *
 * There is documentation that says initilization on the SD
 * shouldn't be done any faster than 400 KHz to be compatible
 * with MMC which is open drain.  We don't have to be compatible
 * with that.  We've tested at 8MHz and everything seems to
 * work fine.
 *
 * Normal operation occurs at 8MHz.  The usci on the 2618 can be
 * run as fast as smclk which can be set to be the main dco frequency
 * which is at 8MHz.  Currently we run at 8MHz.   The SPI runs at
 * DCO/1 to maximize its performance.  Timers run at DCO/8 (max
 * divisor) to get 1uis ticks.  If we increase DCO to 16 MHz there
 * is a problem with the main timer because the max divisor is
 * /8.  This impacts timing for all the timers.
