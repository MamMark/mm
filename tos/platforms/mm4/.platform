# Includes that should take precedence come first.  Platforms come before
# chips because they may override files.  These must be specified as
# @includes instead of -I's to @opts, otherwise the %T won't be processed
# by ncc.
#
# $(MM_ROOT)/support/make/mm4.target includes PFLAG modifications that
# set up include paths that come in first.  That is where
# $(MM_ROOT)/tos/platforms/mm4 and /mm3 are included.  That is why
# %P and %P/../mm3 don't show up below.
#
# %P refers to the local platform file: $(MM_ROOT)/tos/platforms/mm4
# %P/../.. gets us to tos/
# %P/../../.. is root of the tree.  ie. $(MM_ROOT) which doesn't
# work in this file.
#
# support/utils/include moved to include.   include is pulled in via
# the support/make/mm4.target.
